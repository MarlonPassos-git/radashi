### Usage

Given an object and a `toKey` callback function, returns a new object with all the keys
mapped through the `toKey` function. The callback is given both the key and value for each entry.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const ra = {
  mode: 'god',
  power: 'sun',
}

_.mapKeys(ra, key => key.toUpperCase()) // => { MODE, POWER }
_.mapKeys(ra, (key, value) => value) // => { god: 'god', power: 'power' }
```
