### Usage

A reduce that handles callback functions that return a promise.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const userIds = [1, 2, 3, 4]

const users = await _.reduce(
  userIds,
  async (acc, userId) => {
    const user = await api.users.find(userId)
    return {
      ...acc,
      [userId]: user,
    }
  },
  {},
)
```

### Search terms

- Often called `asyncReduce`, `asyncFold`, or `reduceAsync` in other libraries.

### Popular use cases

- Aggregating results from an array of promises where each promise's result is dependent on the previous result.
- Performing complex, sequential data transformations on large datasets within a controlled asynchronous context.
- Sequentially processing a list of tasks where each task needs the result of the previously resolved task, especially in data pipelines or batch processing scenarios.
